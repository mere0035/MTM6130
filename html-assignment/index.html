        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Katherine Meredith, this is my 1<sup>st</sup> semester of Interactive Media Design and I am excited to be starting this journey as an <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student. Creating and designing media has always been a passion of mine. I used to make custom t-shirts for holidays and events and eventually came to the realization that I enjoyed the design process much more than the process of applying the design to the shirts.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy crafting, playing the occasional PC game, and spending time with my family. I also <em>love</em> to cook at home and try different cuisines to recreate at home.  Now that the weather is warmer I look forward to exploring the numerous trails around my home in Kanata and taking my two children out fishing at the cottage. </p>
